The credit_card_transaction dataset is taken from kaggle.com from below link
**https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india**
Using credit_card_transaction dataset,I have analysed the number of scenarios.Some of the questions are mentioned below.
 write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends 
 write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type
 write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when
it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)
 write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type
 write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)
 write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type
 which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014
 during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio 
 which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city
